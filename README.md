A team project where we developed a File Sharing Platform which enables users to upload and download (Large ~GB) files to a central local cloud-like server.

Probable Features of the system:

-Define file sharing policies (like who could access/update/modify which file) -Visualization of set of files currently available in the server, last update time, owner/uploader, last downloader info, number of downloads, size, user-specific download % status -A user connection may abruptly gets terminated; make suitable provisions such that on reconnection resume from the same point -Make provisions there will be a few (2 or 3) redundant servers to deal with server failures and load balancing.

***The system satisfies the following requirements:

-Enables user login from different terminals from different physical machines -Enables User registration and authentication (using some hash-based password) -A user-friendly text interface -A multithreaded platform
